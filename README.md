# Python Outfit
A Python script that integrates the [OpenWeather API.](https://openweathermap.org/) 

Here is a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/MpIeeOxVdt8) that details the steps taken to create this little project and the inspiration behind it.

To run, after generating an API key on the OpenWeather site, ensure you have Python installed. 
Then in the terminal, ensure you are in the root directory and simply run the command
`python outfit.py 12345` replacing 12345 with your desired United States ZIP code.
